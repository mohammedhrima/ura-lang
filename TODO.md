# Testing Plan: ASSIGN with Operations



## Edge Cases & Combined Operations
- [ ] Chained assignments: a = b = c
- [ ] Complex expressions: a = (b + c) * (d - e)
- [ ] Nested function calls: a = f(g(h()))
- [ ] Type mismatches (if applicable)
- [ ] Null/undefined values (if applicable)
- [ ] Operator precedence in assignments
- [ ] Assignment with side effects
